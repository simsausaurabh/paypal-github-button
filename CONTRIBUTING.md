# Contributing
## Code
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.

## Branches
We prefer to prefix branches with `dev/` or `bug/` to hint at the goal of a branch.

### Useful
- `dev/create.smaller.badge`
- `dev/twolfson/custom.padding`
    - Feel free to add in your username
- `bug/fix.font.size`
- `bug/12/support.more.fonts`
    - Feel free to add in the issue number

### Not useful
- `dev/twolfson`
    - Tells us who is working on it but not the intent
- `bug/1234`
    - Tells us the issue number but nothing about the bug itself

## Releases
We provide a runbook for the release process in [`RELEASING.md`][].
